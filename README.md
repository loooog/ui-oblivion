OBLIVION UI
=========

An exploration of what it takes to build the Oblivion UI in AngularJS/CSS3, D3 for the charts, ThreeJS for the models and animations and possibly Famo.us for a future layout framework. Once complete, it would be interesting to bring such UIs into VR ([glam](https://github.com/tparisi/glam), [mozvr](http://mozvr.com/), unity, unreal engine 4, etc...) to test performance and user experience.
